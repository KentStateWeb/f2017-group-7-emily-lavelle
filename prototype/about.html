        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>Founded in 2008, the Ohio Chop Shop was born from owner Ana’s passion for the fashion and beauty industry. The vision was simple, offer world class salon and spa services in an upbeat modern atmosphere, while respecting our environment. The concept was a hit, and Ohio Chop Shop was fast on it’s way to making waves in the Lancaster beauty industry. After two exciting years, the Ohio Chop Shop was outgrowing the original 2400 square foot space located in the historic Akron Tire Factory. When additional space became available adjacent to the existing salon, Ana jumped at it. By adding close to 2600 square feet of ultimate spa space, and more than doubling in size, the Ohio Chop Shop was now poised to command the Akron health and beauty market. Virtually simultaneously Ana reconnected with long time acquaintance Nate and a new Chop Shop partnership was forged. Having worked for some of entertainment's most popular celebrities and in some of the most prestigious salons in the world, Nate was able to bring something completely unique to Akron.. Armed with a shared vision, an incredible team, and an unrelenting commitment to your ultimate satisfaction Ana and Nate are prepared to take something already special and make it something exceptional.</p>
